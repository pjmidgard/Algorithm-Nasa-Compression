Algorithm Nasa Compression

Developed: Jurijus Pacalovas

Presentation: 
My name is Jurijus Pacalovas.
I had read literature about compression like RLE, Huffman, PI, and API.
I started to think about compression from 2013 year and 1 I had seen the dream about my algorithm, but was new RLE and so how I had compression random file and this happen.
RLE Algorithm: could be deleting the same information or find information.
Huffman Algorithm: it is deleting long and make long smaller, e.g. Huffman 0, 10, 11.
PI Algorithm: its write information where find and the end.
API compression algorithm: it takes from 1 to 348 variations.
Calculus Algorithm it take 14 bits and find what not exist and write it, also need write 1 for compress 0 when not compress or just compress like this 2^n. Need add ones then delete it.
Algorithm White hole 2024:
New Pi:
Pi:
Need to count pi 10 Millions, 131 bits, 34 symbols like this 0, 10, 110000-111111, 6000 bits just on the start.
Next I will try making compression better.
Bye, bye.
